Project steps.

1. Get data and read data to construct the graphs of each trace data when compared with another trace data.

2. Construct a matrix from the trace data from step 1 with KLD (Kulbach leiber) values and JSD Jensen Shannon Divergence.

3. Run Minimum Spanning Tree (Prims or Kruskal) algorithm on the matrix that you computed. (Last Project Covered Steps 1-3)

4. Run Community detection- Girvan Newman algorithm and Louvain algorithm (Python packages) on MST.

5. Use the output of Step 4 and create confusion matrix of the families. (For each family of malware from the original data- compare how the constructed communities which we call as constructed families)

6. Pick the families and use graph neural nets to test the prediction.
